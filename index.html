<p>Hi, I am Stefano Huber. I am a student of computer science at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>, passionate of algorithms, theoretical CS and machine learning.</p>
<p>When I am not studying, I like practicing sports: tennis, basketball and riding my mountain bike are my favourite!</p>
<h1 id="education">Education</h1>
<p>At the moment, I am a master student of computer science at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a> and previously I have studied computer science at the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/en">University of Trento</a>. Before university, I have attended the Scientific High School Galilei Trento, where I have developed my passion for computer science taking part in multiple <a href="https://www.lsgalilei.org/index.php/palma-res/879-bronzo-ai-mondiali-della-robotica-in-cina">robotics</a> and <a href="https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/index.php/selezione-nazionale.html">coding</a> competitions.</p>
<h4 id="epfl-master-in-computer-science-sep-2019---present">EPFL Master in computer science (Sep 2019 -&gt; Present)</h4>
<p>At present, I am attending the Master in computer science at <strong>EPFL</strong>. The courses I am taking are focused on algorithms, probability and machine learning. The courses I am most fond of are so far (in no particular order):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-algorithms-CS-450">Advanced Algorithms</a>: focused on matroids, linear programming, probabilistic and approximated algorithms.</li>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/topics-in-theoretical-computer-science-CS-455">Topics in Theoretical CS</a>: all about crazy spectral graph theory.</li>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-probability-and-applications-COM-417">Advanced Probability and Applications</a>: where we covered, among others, martingales, convergence of random variables, random vectors.</li>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/probabilistic-methods-in-combinatorics-MATH-467">Probabilistic Methods in Combinatorics</a>: where we used the probabilistic methods to prove many unexpected results.</li>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/artificial-neural-networks-CS-456">Artificial Neural Networks</a>: where we learned the basis of <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> (and how to play pong).</li>
<li><a href="https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/applied-data-analysis-CS-401">Applied Data Analysis</a>: for friends ADA, where we wrote some code. A lot of <a href="https://github.com/steber97/RecursionFairies_AdaProject">code</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am co-author of a paper about <strong>entity-matching</strong>, written during my semester project (autumn 2020) at <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/">dlab</a>. The paper has been pre-published in February 2021 and still needs to be approved.</p>
<h4 id="university-of-trento-bachelors-in-computer-science-sep-2016---jul-2019">University of Trento, Bachelor&rsquo;s in computer science (Sep 2016 -&gt; Jul 2019)</h4>
<p>I graduated with 110/110 with honour, my theses focused on <strong>link prediction</strong> algorithms and was written under the supervision of professor <a href="http://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/">Alberto Montresor</a>.</p>
<p>The best course I have taken is definitely <a href="http://cricca.disi.unitn.it/montresor/teaching/asd/">algorithms and data structures</a>, where my group and I (<em>fatine_ricorsine</em> Italian for recursion fairies) managed to be the top team during the projects!</p>
<h4 id="scientific-high-school-galileo-galilei-trento-sep-2011---jul-2016">Scientific High School Galileo Galilei Trento (Sep 2011 -&gt; Jul 2016)</h4>
<p>I graduated with 100/100. But, out of all the subjects that I have studied, what made this period so special were the competitions that we did out of scope of our classes: with my robotics team <em>Rescue Maze Galilei</em>, we achieved 1st and 2nd place in the Robocup Italy consecutively in 2015 ans 2016 (for the category Rescue Maze), and got 3rd in the 2015 international Robocup competition in <strong>Hefej, China</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="working-experience">Working Experience</h1>
<p>While studying at university, I managed to gain working experiences working part-time or doing internships for some companies:</p>
<h4 id="qboid-feb-2021---present">QBOID (Feb 2021 -&gt; Present)</h4>
<p>I am working part-time for the <strong>Californian</strong> startup <a href="https://qboid.ai/">QBOID</a>, where I solve computer vision tasks using <strong>OpenCV</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="schoolcalendar-feb-2020---present">SchoolCalendar (Feb 2020 -&gt; Present)</h4>
<p>I am one of the main contributors of the open-source web application <a href="https://schoolcalendar.it">SchoolCalendar</a>: this tool allows school headmasters to manage the professors&rsquo; and courses&rsquo; workload: as crazy as it may seem, generating a proper timetable is an NP complete problem (so full credits to whom is able to do it on paper)! At the moment two schools are adopting it (CFP Tesero and IFPA Levico), both in Trentino region, with promising results.</p>
<h4 id="spaziodati-feb-2019---jun-2019">SpazioDati (Feb 2019 -&gt; Jun 2019)</h4>
<p>I did an internship with <a href="https://spaziodati.eu/en/">SpazioDati</a>, under the supervision of Alessio Guerrieri. There I explored link prediction algorithms, applying them to their vast temporal datasets of the application <em>atoka</em>, a popular &ldquo;social network&rdquo; of Italian companies.</p>
<h4 id="motorialab-sep-2017---jul-2019">Motorialab (Sep 2017 -&gt; Jul 2019)</h4>
<p>I have been working part-time for two years at <a href="https://motorialab.com">Motorialab</a> as a backend developer using the framework <strong>Django</strong>. Their biggest product is <em>Safe</em>, a platform where ski-areas administrators can register the accidents that happen on ski slopes. Here some <a href="https://motorialab.com/en/motorialab/">pictures</a> of the team having fun :)</p>
<h4 id="carluccios-jul-aug-2017">Carluccio&rsquo;s (Jul-Aug 2017)</h4>
<p>During the summer break of 2017, after having finished my exams, I worked as kitchen porter at the London <a href="https://www.carluccios.com/">Carluccio&rsquo;s</a> restaurant. Although it didn&rsquo;t help me much in developing my coding skills, it certainly improved my English!</p>
<h1 id="awards">Awards</h1>
<p>Since high school, I have been extremely fond of coding competitions: they are a great way to improve my skills of working under pressure, they are extremely challenging and, more importantly, they are great fun!</p>
<p>Some awards that I achieved during the years:</p>
<ol>
<li>Winner of the 2020 edition of Bending Spoons&rsquo; <a href="https://firstascent.io/">First Ascent</a> (online, guess the year), after having solved multiple challenges of logics and coding.</li>
<li>Finalist of 2019 Bending Spoons&rsquo; (24th overall) <a href="https://codeflows.io">CodeFlows</a> Milan, algorithms competition divided in multiple rounds.</li>
<li>Winner of <a href="http://2019.ictdays.it/it/events/hackathon.html">Vodafone Tobi Hack</a> Trento, a 24h non-stop hackathon where we helped Vodafone&rsquo;s bot Tobi to achieve better performance.</li>
<li>2nd place in <a href="https://www.analisidifesa.it/2019/05/cy4games-il-team-dellunipg-1-vince-la-gara-di-hacker/">Cy4Games</a> in Rome, an attack-defence CTF.</li>
<li>1st Italian university team at 2018 <a href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/">Google Hash Code</a> (RecursionFairies), a competition where we had to develop an approximated algorithm to assign in an profitable way taxis to customers.</li>
<li>Bronze Methal at the Italian Olympics in Informatics <a href="https://www.olimpiadi-informatica.it/index.php/selezione-nazionale.html">OII</a> 2015, an algorithm competition.</li>
<li>3rd place in 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup_Junior#Rescue_Line_%7C_Maze_challenge">Robocup Jr</a> Hefei in the category Rescue Maze. In order to participate, we built a robot that managed to go through a maze without getting lost, rescuing victims. Even though we had a large economic disadvantage (some of our competitor&rsquo;s wheels where more expensive than our entire robot), we still achieved 3rd place!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mgi6sFbqrQ">Here</a> a video of our best run.</li>
<li>1st Place in 2015 <a href="">Robocup Jr Italy</a>: we were the first team to win in the category Rescue Maze, using open hardware Arduino, as opposed to the closed hardware Lego Mindstorm.</li>
